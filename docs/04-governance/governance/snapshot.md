## What this doc covers

ADR-0067 explains *why* the snapshot exists and *what* it contains. This governance doc covers:

1. **How** an agent uses the snapshot on session start (the §0.1 contract).
2. **How** the snapshot interacts with `codebase-memory-mcp` (the structural knowledge graph).
3. **How** to extend the snapshot when a new dynamic-context source appears.
4. **Failure modes** and what the agent should do when sections degrade.

## The §0.1 contract

Every agent that loads `sergeant-start-here` MUST run `pnpm snapshot` before loading any
specialist skill. The script is zero-dep, offline-safe, and degrades gracefully. The
agent reads `.kilocode/snapshot.md` and reacts to its 8 sections:

| Section                 | Failure mode              | Agent action when healthy             | Agent action when degraded         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Repo                    | never                     | orient                                | (n/a — never fails)                |
| CI last run on main     | `gh` unavailable          | investigate if red before opening PR  | proceed with caution, manual check |
| Budgets                 | bundle script missing     | load `sergeant-deploy-and-observability` if >95% | proceed, no live budget signal |
| Open entropy issues     | `gh` unavailable          | load `sergeant-tech-debt` if touched surface mentioned | proceed, surface not in scope |
| Recent PR-ledger        | index parse error         | skim for adjacent work                | proceed, no recent-context signal  |
| Hard-rule drift         | registry sync error       | re-read named rule before acting      | proceed at own risk                |
| Initiative deadlines    | date parse error          | read named initiative file            | proceed                            |
| Agent hints             | never                     | apply                                  | (n/a)                              |

A "degraded" section reads `[unavailable: <reason>]` — the agent MUST NOT block on
degraded sections; it MUST log them and continue. The snapshot's job is to provide
*signal*, not to gate.

## Interaction with codebase-memory-mcp

`codebase-memory-mcp` (the structural knowledge graph indexed from `D:\Sergeant`)
answers **structural** questions:

- "Where is `useFinykCache` defined and who calls it?"
- "Which files import `@sergeant/shared/lib/macros`?"
- "What's the cyclomatic complexity of `registerRoutes`?"

The snapshot answers **state** questions:

- "Is CI green?"
- "Are bundle budgets under 95%?"
- "Which entropy-janitor issues are open and touch the surface I'm about to edit?"
- "Which TODO-dated initiatives expire in the next 30 days?"

These are **complementary, not redundant**. The recommended flow on session start:

```
1. pnpm snapshot                 → .kilocode/snapshot.md       (state, ~1s)
2. Read §0.1 reactions in SKILL  → decide which specialist skill
3. Load specialist skill         → read its rules + governance
4. For code-structure questions: → codebase-memory-mcp (search_graph, trace_path,
                                    get_code_snippet)        (structure, on demand)
```

The two are **layered**: snapshot first (fast, cheap, gives context for routing),
codebase-memory second (expensive, gives answers for specific file/function questions).
Running codebase-memory *before* the snapshot wastes tokens — you do not yet know
which question to ask the graph.

### Where they overlap

- **Dead-code signal.** Janitors (snapshot-adjacent) run `knip`; codebase-memory
  tracks function definitions and call sites. They may surface the same dead export
  via different paths. The janitor opens a GitHub issue; codebase-memory shows
  call-graph depth. Both are correct; the agent reads whichever the current step
  needs.
- **Circular dependencies.** `dep-cycles` janitor walks imports; codebase-memory
  resolves them via LSP. The janitor outputs an issue; the graph outputs a
  structured cycle. Same finding, two consumers.
- **PR-ledger entries.** Snapshot lists recent PRs from `docs/04-governance/pr-ledger/index.json`;
  codebase-memory links them via `touchedDocs`. The agent should treat the snapshot
  list as a "skim before opening a PR" signal and the graph as "find every file this
  PR touched" deep-dive.

## Extending the snapshot

When adding a new section to `tools/agent-snapshot/snapshot.mjs`:

1. **Must** write the section under 5 KB on its own; the `<50 KB` total cap is enforced.
2. **Must** degrade to `[unavailable: <reason>]` on any error — never throw, never
   abort the rest of the report (ADR-0067 §Decision).
3. **Must not** read Pino destinations, GitHub PATs, or any field whose name
   contains `token` / `secret` / `password` (Hard Rule #21).
4. **Should** reuse the existing `gh` / `git` wrappers in the script; if you need
   a new external tool, justify it in the PR body (no new deps without ADR).
5. **Must** update §0.1 in `sergeant-start-here/SKILL.md` with the new section's
   agent-action rule. The §0.1 contract is the user-facing layer of this governance.
6. **Must** append a `pr-ledger` entry on merge (Hard Rule #26). Placeholder OK
   pre-merge; `update-pr-backlinks` CI replaces the PR number at merge time.

## Failure modes — what the agent does

| Failure                                            | Agent behavior                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm snapshot` not installed (script missing)     | Skip §0.1, log a warning, proceed (CI enforces the script's presence on `main`). |
| `.kilocode/snapshot.md` older than 60 min          | Re-run `pnpm snapshot --refresh`.                         |
| A single section returns `[unavailable: ...]`      | Continue with the other sections. Note the gap in the session's own worklog. |
| Total snapshot >50 KB                              | Truncation drops the richest sections first. The agent should prefer the §0.1 actions it *can* see over the ones it cannot. |
| Cache file corrupted                              | `pnpm snapshot --refresh` (re-runs all sections, overwrites cache). |
