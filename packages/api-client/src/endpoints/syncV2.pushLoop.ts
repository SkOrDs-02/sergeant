/**
 * Composable, dependency-injected push-loop orchestrator that
 * implements one tick of the client-side sync engine: drain the local
 * `sync_op_outbox`, push the batch to `/api/v2/sync/push`, then advance
 * each row's lifecycle (success / transient retry / terminal reject)
 * based on the server's per-op result.
 *
 * Stage 5 PR #042e-pushloop of `docs/planning/storage-roadmap.md`.
 * Pairs with PR #042e-lifecycle (write-side helpers in db-schema:
 * `markOutboxSuccess` / `markOutboxRetry` / `markOutboxRejected`),
 * PR #042e-drain (read-side helper), PR #042d-builder (enqueue helper),
 * PR #042e-mapping (camelCase ↔ snake_case envelope translation),
 * and PR #042e-submit (build → map → enqueue producer pipeline).
 *
 * Why DI rather than direct imports of `drainSyncOpOutbox`,
 * `markOutbox*`, and `planRetry`? Because `api-client` and `db-schema`
 * deliberately do NOT depend on each other (PR #042d-builder Risk
 * note in the roadmap). Inversion of control through function-shaped
 * dependencies keeps the package boundary clean while still letting
 * the consumer module (sync engine boot path; not in scope here)
 * call a single one-tick entry-point:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const result = await runSyncEnginePushOnce(
 *   {
 *     drain: (opts) => drainSyncOpOutbox(sqliteClient, opts),
 *     push: (ops, opts) => syncV2.pushV2(ops, opts),
 *     markSuccess: (id) => markOutboxSuccess(sqliteClient, id),
 *     markRetry: (id, plan) => markOutboxRetry(sqliteClient, id, plan),
 *     markRejected: (id, reason) =>
 *       markOutboxRejected(sqliteClient, id, reason),
 *     planRetry,
 *     now: () => new Date(),
 *   },
 *   { limit: 100, originDeviceId: deviceId },
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * The actual periodic-timer wiring (boot, online/offline events,
 * push-on-enqueue flush, Sentry breadcrumbs) is intentionally out of
 * scope and ships in a follow-up wiring PR. This module is pure
 * orchestration: same input → same lifecycle writes → same return
 * shape. Tests pin the dispatch table by stubbing every dependency.
 *
 * Selection / dispatch contract:
 *
 * - The drain helper already filters to `status='pending'` and
 *   `next_retry_at IS NULL OR next_retry_at <= now`, ordered by
 *   `id ASC`, capped at `limit`. The orchestrator passes its own
 *   `now` (from `deps.now()`) so a single tick is monotonic — no
 *   clock skew between drain and lifecycle writes.
 * - On `drained.length === 0`: return `{drained:0,…}` immediately,
 *   no HTTP call, no lifecycle writes.
 * - On HTTP success (`fetch` resolves with a parsed
 *   {@link SyncV2PushResponse}): the orchestrator matches each
 *   per-op `SyncV2OpResult` to its drained row by `idempotency_key`
 *   (the only field guaranteed to round-trip 1:1 from request → DB →
 *   response). For each row:
 *   * `applied` or `duplicate` → {@link MarkOutboxSuccessFn} (DELETE).
 *   * `rejected` → {@link MarkOutboxRejectedFn} with `reason` (kept
 *     verbatim). Empty / missing `reason` falls back to a stable
 *     `unspecified` literal so the dev panel never shows `null`.
 *   * Unknown server-side status → {@link MarkOutboxRetryFn} via
 *     `planRetry` with `last_error="unknown_status:<value>"`. Forward-
 *     compat with future server statuses; the row stays in the queue
 *     and the next tick re-pushes once the orchestrator code is
 *     updated.
 *   * Missing result for a known idempotency_key → same as unknown
 *     status, with `last_error="missing_result"`. The server is
 *     supposed to return one result per op submitted; if it doesn't,
 *     leaving the row in `pending` and bumping `attempts` is safer
 *     than silently dropping it.
 * - On HTTP failure (any thrown error from `deps.push`): the entire
 *   batch goes to {@link MarkOutboxRetryFn}. The error is classified
 *   via {@link describePushError} into a stable, low-cardinality
 *   string (`network`, `timeout`, `http_5xx`, `http_503`, …) so
 *   `last_error` keeps a bounded label space (analytics rollup
 *   cardinality budget — see Stage 5 reject-reason hygiene rule).
 *   `ApiError.kind === 'http'` with `status === 401 | 403` (auth) is
 *   propagated as `auth_<status>` and is still treated as transient
 *   — the engine has no way to mint new credentials on its own;
 *   re-auth happens out of band, after which the next tick re-pushes.
 *
 * Idempotency on retry:
 *
 * - The server dedups on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`, so a re-push
 *   of the same batch returns `duplicate` for already-applied rows
 *   and `applied` for fresh ones. This means a transient failure
 *   between "DB write" and "HTTP response received" is recoverable
 *   without a custom replay store: the row stays in `pending`, the
 *   next tick re-pushes, and the server short-circuits the apply.
 *   The orchestrator does NOT need to special-case this.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *
 * - Two concurrent ticks (e.g. periodic timer + manual "force sync"
 *   button) can both drain the same rows. The lifecycle helpers are
 *   guarded against this — `markOutbox{Success,Retry,Rejected}` are
 *   idempotent on missing rows and refuse to advance non-pending
 *   ones (PR #042e-lifecycle). So overlapping ticks are safe; they
 *   just observe a partially-drained state on the slower side.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *
 * - The orchestrator does NOT catch errors thrown by the DI helpers
 *   (`drain`, `markSuccess`, `markRetry`, `markRejected`,
 *   `planRetry`). Storage-layer failures (disk full, schema drift,
 *   FS lock) propagate to the caller — the sync engine boot path is
 *   responsible for global error handling / Sentry. Catching them
 *   here would silently lose the row.
 * - A {@link DrainedOutboxRowShape} whose `op` is outside the
 *   `SyncV2OpKind` tuple is impossible — `drainSyncOpOutbox` itself
 *   throws on out-of-tuple ops. The mapping below assumes the input
 *   is well-formed.
