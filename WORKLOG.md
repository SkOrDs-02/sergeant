## Acceptance criteria checklist
- [x] AC-1: All 4 upstream PR verified merged in origin/main (#72, #73, #74, #75)
- [x] AC-2: WORKLOG.md created first
- [x] AC-3: All 4 ADRs cross-read (0066, 0067, 0068, 0069)
- [x] AC-4: `docs/90-work/planning/harness-engineering-v1.md` created with required sections
- [x] AC-5: `AGENTS.md` § Harness-engineering v1 appended (Hard Rules table untouched)
- [x] AC-6: `agent-skills-catalog.md` minimal entries added (snapshot, janitors)
- [x] AC-7: `pnpm check` partial — own files green, repo-wide pre-existing failures on out-of-scope files (documented in Verification runs)
- [x] AC-8: `pnpm lint:hard-rules-registry` green
- [x] AC-9: `pnpm lint:codeowners` green
- [ ] AC-10: Draft PR created (NOT merged)

## Decisions log
- 2026-06-30 16:36 — Confirmed all 4 PRs (#72-#75) merged in origin/main after user re-check.
- 2026-06-30 16:40 — `git worktree add` based on local main; manually `git reset --hard origin/main` to capture the merge commits (local trunk was stale).
- 2026-06-30 16:42 — `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` failed (lockfile drift from entropy-janitors merge); running plain `pnpm install`.

## Blockers / open questions
- (none)

## Sub-tasks status
- [x] 16:36 — re-fetch origin, verify all 4 PR merged
- [x] 16:40 — create worktree D:\sergeant-wt\harness-v1-summary, branch devin/1782826662-harness-v1-summary
- [x] 16:41 — reset worktree to origin/main
- [x] 16:42 — pnpm install (in background, lockfile drift required plain install)
- [x] 16:45 — read §0 and §5.5 of harness-plan.md
- [x] 16:46 — cross-read 4 ADRs (0066 entropy-janitors, 0067 dynamic-agent-snapshot, 0068 harness-versioning, 0069 ai-pr-checklist)
- [x] 16:48 — read 4 PR commit bodies via `git show`
- [x] 16:50 — inspect `tools/`, `docs/04-governance/governance/`, `AGENTS.md`, `agent-skills-catalog.md`, `pr-ledger/index.json`
- [x] 16:52 — write `docs/90-work/planning/harness-engineering-v1.md`
- [x] 16:54 — append `Harness-engineering v1` section to AGENTS.md (end of file, Hard Rules table untouched)
- [x] 16:55 — add minimal entries to `agent-skills-catalog.md`
- [ ] run `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint:hard-rules-registry`, `pnpm lint:codeowners`
- [ ] commit, push, open draft PR

## Verification runs
- ✅ `pnpm lint:hard-rules-registry` — green (26 rules in sync)
- ✅ `pnpm lint:codeowners` — green (35 paths covered)
- ✅ `pnpm --filter @sergeant/entropy-janitors typecheck` — green
- ✅ `pnpm --filter @sergeant/entropy-janitors test` — green (17/17)
- ✅ `pnpm exec prettier --check <my-3-files>` — green
- ⚠️ `pnpm check` — full repo fails on pre-existing prettier warnings
  on files I did not touch (`.github/workflows/ai-pr-checklist.yml`,
  `docs/04-governance/adr/0069-ai-pr-checklist.md`,
  `docs/04-governance/governance/ai-pr-checklist.md`, `docs/00-start/agents/loops/*`,
  `docs/02-engineering/integrations/README.md`, `docs/90-work/research/audience-discovery-kit/*`).
  Per plan §0.3 ("Не редагуй жоден з 4 upstream PR (вони вже змерджені)")
  these are out of scope for this summary PR.
- ⚠️ `pnpm check:typecheck-and-test` — 10 of 27 tasks cache-hit/successful;
  1 pre-existing failure in `@sergeant/openclaw-plugin#test`
  (`src/index.test.ts`: "registers exactly the 25 read-tools + 5 write-tools"
  and "every write-tool exposes a label" — known tool catalog drift in
  `packages/openclaw-plugin/`, unrelated to harness-engineering work).

## Handoff notes (for review session)
- 4 upstream PRs in scope:
  - #72 — feat(agents): add AI-PR checklist and validation workflow
  - #73 — feat(agents): add dynamic agent snapshot for harness context
  - #74 — feat(agents): add scheduled entropy janitors (doc-drift, dead-code, dep-cycles)
  - #75 — feat(agents): add harness versioning and A/B evaluation workflow
- All 4 ADRs (0066-0069) referenced from summary doc.
- Local files touched by this session (after worktree reset to origin/main):
  - `docs/90-work/planning/harness-engineering-v1.md` (new)
  - `AGENTS.md` (appended § Harness-engineering v1 only — Hard Rules table intact)
  - `docs/00-start/agents/agent-skills-catalog.md` (minimal append for snapshot + janitors)
- Local `pnpm-lock.yaml` will drift because we had to `pnpm install` (not --frozen) due to entropy-janitors lockfile drift introduced by the merge of PR #74. This is expected; CI will re-lock on next push.
- Plan file deletion: `E:\Temp\kilo\harness-plan.md` will be safe to remove after this PR merges.
